        <p class="bio">
          My passion for computer science started when I wrote my first program
          to print "hello world." Today, I'm an aspiring computer scientist
          studying at Portland State University. One project I worked on while
          studying was building a database using SQL to provide a list of
          financial reports, lists of services, lists of providers, and monthly
          reports for clients using Chocan software. This happened over eleven
          weeks using the modified waterfall methodology. Apart from that, I
          work in the IT department for a private food processing company in
          Portland. While working, I have learned and continue to learn about
          Internet protocol, software troubleshooting, server management, and
          more. However, I do see myself working in the fields of cybersecurity
          or artificial intelligence. Although that is what will support me
          financially, I still have a love for music. I plan to continue
          mastering musical instruments to one day have a group of mine and play
          for events as I have already been playing.

              Worked alongside my father carrying out several manual labor tasks
              despite tough weather conditions. This taught me the value of
              working hard, gave me a sense of responsibility, and inspired me
              to continue studying in appreciation of my father.
