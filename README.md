# Personal-Portfolio
A combination of HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT to make a personal portfolio 
## Project Description 
 The main content of the website is split into four different sections: about, experience, project, and form. A navigation bar, based on the options, brings the user to a section on the web page. 

The content constitutes the professional website project that highlights my personal experience. Although not practical, I implemented a single webpage to further develop my skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

This was the final project for CS463: Web Development
